# Problem 1

Given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
Output : 5

Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
Output : 7

A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node.
Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored a index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.

Example of Min Heap:

            5                      13
         /      \               /       \  
       10        15           16         31 
      /                      /  \        /  \
    30                     41    51    100   41
How is Min Heap represented?
A Min Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A Min heap is typically represented as an array. The root element will be at Arr[0]. For any ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:

Arr[(i -1) / 2] returns its parent node.
Arr[(2 * i) + 1] returns its left child node.
Arr[(2 * i) + 2] returns its right child node.
Operations on Min Heap:

getMin(): It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
